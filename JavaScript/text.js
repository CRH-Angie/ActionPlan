JavaScript is an Interpreted, JIT Compiled. As we observed, 
Compilation ensures that the compiled code is optimized for faster execution & 
Interpreter ensures that code execution can immediately ensure faster startup.
- implementation detail and completely dependent on the engine and the engine decides what to do.


8 - Engines & Runtime Environment 
Engine: takes code and execute it. (processor)
test262 - t69(company)
Environment: where our code is being executed (e.g. browser)
compile: take all code and transform it into what the engine can understand
Interpret: run line by line
JIT => Just-In-Time compilation; 

9 - local vs global variables
10 - block scoping
