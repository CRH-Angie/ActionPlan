            </ul>
            <h3>How Website Performance Impacts Facebook</h3>
            <p>If your post links to a slow website, it may not be displayed to people using the Facebook app.</p>
            <h3>How Quickly Should a Page Load?</h3>
            <p>Best-in-class webpages should become interactive within <strong>5.3 seconds</strong>. Any slower and visitors will abandon your site, reducing conversions and sales</p>
            <h3>Will people come back to a slow site?</h3>
            <p><strong>79%</strong> of shoppers who are dissatisfied with site performance say they’re less likely to purchase from the same site again.</p>
            <h3>Website Performance Affects:</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Your web design</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Accessibility</h3>

            <h3>Usability</h3>
            <p>How efficiently and easily visitors can see or examine your website.</p>
            <h3>Website Design</h3>

            <h3>Performance Budget</h3>
            <p>Benchmarks for the performance metrics that you care about.</p>
            <h3>Load Speed</h3>
            <p>The time it takes to fully display the content on a specific page.</p>
            <h3>First Contentful Paint (FCP)</h3>
            <p>The time it takes in seconds for text or images to be shown to users.</p>
            <h3>Time to Interactive (TTI)</h3>
            <p>When the page responds to user interactions (such as clicking) within 50ms.</p>
            <h3>Minification</h3>
            <p>The process of reducing resources size by removing unnecessary comments and spacing in the source code.</p>
            <h3>What Does Minification Do?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML minification</strong> removes all unnecessary characters from the HTML.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS minification</strong> removes all the unnecessary characters and comments from your stylesheet file that contains font and layout rules.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript minification</strong> removes all unnecessary characters and
                    comments from the JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Tools For Minification </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To minify HTML, try out the PageSpeed Insights Chrome extension.</li>
                <li>For CSS, try CSS Compressor.</li>
                <li>For JavaScript, you could use JS Compress.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Compression</h3>
            <p>Replaces repetitive pieces of code with markers directing to the first instance of that code.</p>
            <h3>Minification vs Compression</h3>
            <h4>Minification</h4>
            <p>Removes whitespace, comments, and non-required semicolons.</p>
            <h4>Compression</h4>
            <p>Removes all strings that are repeated.</p>
            <h4>Minified CSS File</h4>
            <p>Once this file is minified, the file size shrinks, but it is also a whole lot harder to read.</p>
            <h4>Compressed CSS File</h4>
            <p>These characters are placemarks for where the duplicate code used to be.</p>
            <h4>Minified and Compressed CSS File</h4>
            <p>This generates the smallest file size of the bunch.</p>
